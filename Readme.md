# The objective of the project is to develop a model that can recognize objects in climatic data. 
The main objectives of the project are listed below:
1. To identify suitable and highly efficient CNN models for Object Recognition.
2. Perform Object Classification and Image detection to assign proper labels to the objects
in the scene.
3. Evaluate the classification performance of the models used.
4. Compare the results of the models used among one another.
